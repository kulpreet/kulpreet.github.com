# Bitcoin

The shape of Bitcoin's adoption curve is, as of yet, unknown. What we
do know is that there is a lot we still need to build.

## Current work

Most recently I have been working on
[Braidpool](https://github.com/pool2win/braidpool). I am using TLA+ to
specify the protocols that make up braidpool and I post the latest
developments on my [blog](https://blog.opdup.com).

## Past work

More of my earlier work can be found on
[Github](https://github.com/kulpreet).

- I started work on specifying a DSL for helping compose and test L2
  contracts. This was built on Racket to enable an external DSL.
- I used to run a small service that tracked [node centrality in the
Lightning Network](https://lnmetrics.opdup.com/). My older blog post
on a commercial platform are on [Medium](https://medium.com/@jungly).
- I briefly engaged with the Rebooting Web of Trust community and
  helped [build tools to develop DIDs using the BTCR spec](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot8-barcelona/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/supporting-btcr.md).
- I am a contributor to libbitcoin - the best way to figure out how
  bitcoin works.

## Fu (remote past tense in Italian)

I studied [consensus
algorithms](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=Ty7PQNwAAAAJ&hl=en)
for my PhD. My post academic life has been spent working with startups
[building products](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zapfmann/) for Web 2.0 and Mobile.
