## Bitcoin

The shape of Bitcoin's adoption curve is, as of yet, unknown. What we
do know is that there is a lot we still need to build.

## Current work

My most recent work can be found at
[Github](https://github.com/kulpreet) and the occasional blog posts
on [Medium](https://medium.com/@jungly).

I run a small service that tracks [node centrality in the Lightning
Network](https://lnmetrics.opdup.com/).

## Past

I studied [consensus
algorithms](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=Ty7PQNwAAAAJ&hl=en)
for my PhD. My post academic life has been spent working with startups
building products for Web 2.0 and Mobile.
